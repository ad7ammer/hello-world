Hello GitWorld!

My name is Adham and I was referred here by a mysterious creature that goes by the name of "Browncake". Mmmm Delicious. Anyways, I come here seeking more new knowledge in this, what seems to be, an infinite world of programming. 
So, welcome me, with open arms. For I am one of you.
